            Hello! My name is Abuh Daniel. I am from Kogi State, Nigeria, and I am
            currently working as a Batching Plant Operator in a construction company.
            I am also a student in the WDD 130 course at BYU–Idaho, where I am learning
            the fundamentals of web development including HTML and CSS.
        </p>

        <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy reading and traveling to explore new places.
            I am excited to combine my professional experience with new web development
            skills to create practical and creative projects throughout this course.
